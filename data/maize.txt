Fall maize varieties include early and drought-tolerant hybrids like SC Sungura 301 (75–85 days, low–mid altitude), SC Duma 419 (~85 days), and SC Duma 43 (85–90 days), ideal for short rains across all zones. OPVs like Katumani KDV-1 (75–90 days) are drought-resistant and suited for arid areas. Medium to long-rain season hybrids such as H513 (110–120 days), H516, and H520 (120–150 days) thrive in mid-to-high altitudes, while H6213, H628, and H629 (150–190 days) are best for highland regions, offering tall, high-yield stalks and excellent husk cover. Versatile hybrids like Tsavo WE4141, Haraka WH101, DK 8031, DKC 8033, and DKC 90-89 provide strong disease resistance and dual-purpose use. Flinty hybrids such as PANNAR 4M-19, and early-maturing lines like PAN 3M-01, PAN 3M-05, and PAN 4A-156 suit varied conditions. Regional OPVs like Uganda’s Longe 4 and Longe 5 (Nalongo), Tanzania’s Situka and UCA/Kilima, and the Philippines' Lagkitan Corn (~72 days) are tailored to local climates and farmer needs. Sweet corn options for dry or irrigated seasons include Buttergold, Spring Treat, Sugar Buns, XtraTender 3473, Anthem XR, Fantastic XR, Vision, Challenger, and Miracle, with 63–84 day maturity and enhanced sweetness. Specialty types like Popcorn (Zea mays everta) (95–120 days), Dent corn (110–160 days, for feed/flour), and Flint corn (120–150 days, for grits) are used commercially. Finally, QPM varieties (100–125 days) offer improved nutritional value with high lysine and tryptophan content, suitable for all seasons and altitudes.
